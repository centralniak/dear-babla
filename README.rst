dear-babla
==========

Helps you learn and memorize English by providing translations and excersises

For some reason (being investigated) does not work with Python 3.4.

Usage
-----

To learn a meaning of new word:

::

    python dearbabla.py unknown

To display a previously learnt word:

::

    python dearbabla.py

You can also make dearbabla pause before it displays the translation so you can try to remember the translation:

::

    python dearbabla.py --delay

Sometimes dearbabla will pickup a disappointing translation. Remove it with

::

    python dearbabla.py --delete bogus
